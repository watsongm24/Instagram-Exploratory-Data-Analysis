## Introduction

Instagram EDA is an exploratory data analysis project that aims to gain insights from Instagram data. It involves the analysis of metrics such as 'Likes,' 'Saves,' and 'Follows' over time. This project helps users understand how their Instagram content performs and can be used for data-driven decision-making.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided code)
- Required Python libraries (Pandas, Plotly, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/watsongm24/Instagram-Exploratory-Data-Analysis.git)

Follow the instructions and code in the notebook to perform your own Instagram EDA.

Data
The data used in this project is typically obtained from Instagram Insights or other data sources. The dataset should include relevant metrics such as 'Likes,' 'Saves,' 'Follows,' and a timestamp.

Exploratory Data Analysis
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process involves loading the Instagram data, cleaning it, and visualizing key metrics. The provided code (instagram_eda.ipynb) demonstrates how to perform the analysis step by step.

Results
The results of the EDA will provide insights into the performance of Instagram posts over time. You will gain a better understanding of how different metrics evolve and can make data-driven decisions to improve your Instagram content strategy.
